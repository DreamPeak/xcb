All commands and replies are in CSV format.  So you can easily drop them into
M$ EXCEL to do crazy things.

S<index>[,pattern]
    Subscribe an 'index' according to a 'pattern'.
    For example: SIMPVBAW
                 SIMPVBAW,m
                 SIMPVBAW,m1603
                 SIMPVBAW,m1603-C-2600

SALL
    Subscribe all indices.

U<index>[,pattern]
    Unsubscribe an 'index' according to a 'pattern'.
    For example: UIMPVBAW
                 UIMPVBAW,m
                 UIMPVBAW,m1603
                 UIMPVBAW,m1603-C-2600

UALL
    Unsubscribe all indices.

ATTENTION: Subscribe/Unsubscribe is symmetrical.  For instance, if you already
subscribed "IMPVBAW,m1603", subscribing "IMPVBAW,m" or "IMPVBAW,m1603-C-2600"
won't succeed because they have inclusion relation with each other.  You must
unsubscribe "IMPVBAW,m1603" first before subscribing "IMPVBAW,m" or
"IMPVBAW,m1603-C-2600".  But you can always subscribe "IMPVBAW,m1603" and
"IMPVBAW,m1605" at the same time, simply because they don't have the inclusion
relation.

Q<index>,<rid>,[pattern],<start time>,<end time>
    Query an 'index' according to a 'pattern', from 'start time' to 'end time'.
    'rid' is a unique identifier for each query.  'start time' and 'end time'
    must be in 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm' or 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss' format.
    For example: QIMPVBAW,123,,2016-02-15 09:00,2016-02-15 10:00
                 QIMPVBAW,123,m1603,2016-02-15 09:00:00,2016-02-15 10:00:30

QC,<rid>
    Cancel a query, using 'rid'.
    For example: QC,123

INDICES,<rid>
    Return all indices you can subscribe/unsubscribe.
    For example: -->INDICES,999
                 <--999,INDICES,GREEKSBAW,IMPVBAW,OTVBAW,VSML

ATTENTION: When your client gets connected to XCUBE, an INDICES message like
this 'INDICES,GREEKSBAW,IMPVBAW,OTVBAW,VSML' will be received.  This message is
going to be updated if some modules are loaded or unloaded.

INDEX,<index>
    Return the format of an 'index'.
    For example: -->INDEX,IMPVBAW
                 <--IMPVBAW,timestamp,contract,lastprice,vol,bidprice1,vol2,
                    askprice1,vol3,spotprice
