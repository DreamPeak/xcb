We start by getting you acquainted with the compactor(xcb-compact) and the
command line interface(xcb-cli).

By typing '

    service xcb-compact start<Enter>

', the compactor is loaded into main memory.  It first reads the config file
'xcb-compact.conf' located in '/etc/xcb/', then optionally loads the modules in
'/var/lib/xcb/', and dumps all info and warning messages into the log file
'xcb-compact.log' which lies in '/var/log/xcb/'.  In certain cases, especially
when you are developing a new module, you may want to run the compactor in
foreground, then type:

    xcb-compact -f /etc/xcb/xcb-compact.conf<Enter>

You can start the command line interface to play with it.
    xcb-cli -?<Enter>
    Usage: xcb-cli [OPTION]...
      -h <hostname> Server hostname (default: 127.0.0.1)
      -p <port>     Server port (default: 33330)
      -x            Execute a command and quit
      -t            Print timestamps
      -?            Output this help and exit
By default, the command line interface connects to localhost on port 33330.
    xcb-cli<Enter>

    Type 'help' or '?' for help.
    xcb*CLI> help<Enter>
                    help  Display this text
                       ?  Synonym for 'help'
                  config  Get or set configurations
                    show  Show modules, applications or queues
                  module  Load, unload or reload module
                 monitor  Monitor on or off
                database  Database operations
                shutdown  Shut down xcb-compact
                    quit  Quit connecting to xcb-compact

You can check all loaded modules.  Their status can be one of the following:
'Running', 'Declined' and 'Failed'.
    xcb*CLI> show modules<Enter>
          app_impvbaw.so  Implied Volatility (BAW) Applications [Status: Running]
             app_vsml.so  Volatility Smile Application [Status: Running]
        app_greeksbaw.so  Greeks (BAW) Application [Status: Running]
           app_otvbaw.so  Option Theoretical Value (BAW) Application [Status: Running]
             app_test.so  Communication Test Application [Status: Running]

You can also check all applications.
    xcb*CLI> show applications<Enter>
                 impvbaw  Implied Volatility (BAW) [Module: app_impvbaw.so]
              mm_impvbaw  Min & Max of Implied Volatility (BAW) [Module: app_impvbaw.so]
                    vsml  Volatility Smile [Module: app_vsml.so]
               greeksbaw  Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho (BAW) [Module: app_greeksbaw.so]
                  otvbaw  Option Theoretical Value (BAW) [Module: app_otvbaw.so]
                    test  Communication Tester [Module: app_test.so]

You can see all 'queues', including the infamous 'default_msgs', and the
applications hooked onto them.
    xcb*CLI> show queues<Enter>
            default_msgs  impvbaw
            impvbaw_msgs  mm_impvbaw, vsml, greeksbaw
               vsml_msgs  otvbaw

You can manually load or unload a specific module.
    xcb*CLI> module load app_kline.so<Enter>
    module 'app_kline.so' loaded OK
    xcb*CLI> module unload app_kline.so<Enter>
    module 'app_kline.so' unloaded OK

ATTENTION: Replacing a running module will lead the compactor crash.  You can
unload the module first, replace, and load it again.

Don't forget the '-x' option.  If you are a system admin, and you want to open
God mode, just type:

    xcb-cli -x monitor on<Enter>
